how to collect the data of COVID-19 in Germany 

step 1: observe the confirmed case numbers of COVID-19 in our world in data website (https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2021-02-16..2021-07-09&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=false&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=~DEU)

Action: download full data (CSV)

get "people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred"

Step 2: get "total_boosters_per_hundred"

Step 3: get "daily_vaccinated_per_hundred_booster" by calculation. daily_vaccinated_per_hundred_booster = people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred + total_boosters_per_hundred - people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred_previous_day - total_boosters_per_hundred_previous_day

Step 4: get "Stringency_index"

Step 5: get "Total_cases"

Step 6: get "daily_cases" by calculation. daily_cases = total_cases - total_cases_previous_day

Step 7: get "Daily_cases_average" by calculation. daily_cases_average = 7 consecutive days' total daily cases divided by 7 

Step 8: get "total_deaths"

Step 9: get "Daily_deaths" by calculation. daily_deaths = total_deaths - total_deaths_previous_day

Step 10: get "Daily_deaths_average" by calculation. Daily_deaths_average = 7 consecutive days' total daily cases divided by 7 

Step 11: get "Total_population" in the csv "owid-covid-data"

Step 12: get "infected" by calculations. infected = last 14 days' daily cases total

Step 13: get "Infected_average" by calculations. The process is similar to daily_cases_average

Step 14: get "Total_recovered" by calculations. Total_recovered = Total_cases - total_deaths - infected 

Step 15: get "Daily_recovered" by calculation. daily_recovered = total_recovered - total_recovered_previous_day

Step 16: get "Daily_recovered_average" by calculation. The process is similar to daily_cases_average

Step 17: look for NPIs related to vaccinated and unvaccinated news

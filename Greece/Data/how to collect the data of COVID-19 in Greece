how to collect the data of COVID-19 in Greece 

step 1: observe the confirmed case numbers of COVID-19 in our world in data website (https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2021-02-16..2021-07-09&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=false&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=~DEU)

Action: download full data (CSV)

look for "people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred" and "total_boosters_per_hundred"

Results: get the information of "daily_vaccinated_per_hundred" by calculation. daily_vaccinated_per_hundred = people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred - people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred_previous_day

ps: compute effectiveness_vaccine, considering the following information: people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred, total_boosters_per_hundred, daily_vaccinated_per_hundred, daily_boosters_per_hundred
by a program named after computeEff.py

ps: compute "people_protection_per_hundred", people_protection_per_hundred = people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred * effectiveness_vaccine

ps: compute "daily_protection_per_hundred", daily_protection_per_hundred is the difference between two days
Step 2: get "Stringency_index"

Step 3: get "New_total_cases", New_total_cases means that the total cases of a new wave. The new wave starts in July 1, 2021. Thus, New_total_cases = total_cases - the new starting of total_cases.

Step 4: get "daily_cases" by calculation. daily_cases = total_cases - total_cases_previous_day

Step 5: get "Daily_cases_average" by calculation. daily_cases_average = 7 consecutive days' total daily cases divided by 7 

Step 6: get "New_total_deaths", New_total_deaths = total_deaths - the new starting of total_cases

Step 7: get "Daily_deaths" by calculation. daily_deaths = total_deaths - total_deaths_previous_day

Step 8: get "Daily_deaths_average" by calculation. Daily_deaths_average = 7 consecutive days' total daily cases divided by 7 

Step 9: get "Total_population" in the csv "owid-covid-data"

Step 10: get "Infected" by calculations. infected = the total cases of last 14 days' daily cases

Step 11: get "Infected_average" by calculations. Infected_average = Infected

Step 12: get "New_total_recovered" by calculations. New_total_recovered = New_total_cases - New_total_deaths - Infected_average

Step 13: get "Daily_recovered" by calculation. daily_recovered = total_recovered - total_recovered_previous_day

Step 14: get "Daily_recovered_average" by calculation. Daily_recovered_average = 7 consecutive days' total daily recovered divided by 7

Step 15: look for NPIs related to vaccinated and unvaccinated news


how to select reasonable hyperparameters:
1. compute the proportion of the quarantined. for example, 30831/10445365 is about 0.003
2. beta * SI/N or beta * VI/N
